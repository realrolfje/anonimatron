/**
 * Provides a {@link ThreadLocal} implementation of {@link StopwatchNano} to facilitate cross-object
 * timing without passing Stopwatch as an argument.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * ThreadLocalStopwatchNano.init("work on thread 1");
 * ThreadLocalStopwatchNano.aboutTo("do other work");
 * ThreadLocalStopwatchNano.aboutTo("finish up");
 * ThreadLocalStopwatchNano.stop(1000);
 * <p/>
 * The example above logs a Warning when the work in the current thread took more than 1000 milliseconds, and will
 * seperate stopwatches between threads. Running the same code in parallel results in two warnings in the log.
